Savage Strike, Maiming Slash, Vicious Slash and Savage Leap all grant stacks of Blood Frenzy.  Each stack of this buff grants a small damage buff and endurance cost discount.  You may have up to 5 stacks of Blood Frenzy active at a time.  Blood Frenzy can be maintained, or it can be consumed to empower Shred, Rending Flurry, Blood Thirst and Hemorrhage.  Using one of these consumers while you have 5 stacks of Blood Frenzy offers an additional benefit to these powers, but will also leave you Exhausted for a short time.
