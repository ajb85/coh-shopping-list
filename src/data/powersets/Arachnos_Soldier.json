Crab Spiders gain access to the \"\"backpack\"\" and the powerful claw/cone attacks it provides, while the Bane Spider track provides stealth and a stronger focus on melee.","imageName":"i12_Pri_Soldier.png","displayName":"Arachnos Soldier","powers":[{"castTimeReal":0.9,"toggleCost":5.2,"displayName":"Single Shot","accuracy":1.05,"accuracyMult":1.05,"attackTypes":18,"target":2048,"targetLoS":true,"range":80,"endCost":5.2,"rechargeTime":4,"baseRechargeTime":4,"effectArea":1,"maxBoosts":"","numAllowed":1,"boostsAllowed":["Accuracy_Boost","Damage_Boost","Debuff_Defense_Boost","EnduranceDiscount_Boost","Range_Boost","Recharge_Boost"],"enhancements":[1,4,6,8,17,18],"description":{"short":"Ranged, Minor DMG(Lethal), Foe -DEF","long":"A quick single shot from the Arachnos Sub-machinegun.
