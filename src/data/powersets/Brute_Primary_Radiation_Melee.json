{"fullName":"Brute_Primary_Radiation_Melee","archetypeOrder":"primary","description":"You are able to harness the power of Radiation to crush your foes in close quarters. Radiation Melee attacks have a chance to inflict the Contaminated state on a target for a moderate amount of time. Powers that deal greater damage, have a longer recharge time and animation time have a greater chance to inflict Contaminated. Hitting Contaminated targets with Contaminated Strike, Radioactive Smash, Radiation Siphon and Devastating Blow cause a portion of that power's damage to also hit nearby foes. Radiation Melee attacks primarily deal smashing and energy damage, but this set is also capable of dealing some toxic damage.","imageName":"RadiationBlast.png","displayName":"Radiation Melee","powers":[{"allowedEnhancements":["Accuracy","Damage","Defense_Debuff","Endurance_Discount","Recharge","Taunt"],"enhancementCount":6,"archetypeOrder":"primary","powerIndex":0,"castTimeReal":0.83,"toggleCost":4.368,"fullName":"Brute_Primary_Radiation_Melee_Contaminated_Strike","displayName":"Contaminated Strike","requires":{"powers":{},"count":0},"accuracy":1,"accuracyMult":1,"attackTypes":137,"target":2048,"targetLoS":true,"range":7,"endCost":4.368,"rechargeTime":3,"baseRechargeTime":3,"effectArea":2,"radius":8,"maxTargets":5,"numAllowed":1,"description":{"short":"Melee, Light DMG(Energy/Smash), Foe -Def, Special","long":"You charge your fist with harmful radioactive particles and quickly strike your foe dealing Light Energy and Smashing damage as well as reducing their defense.
