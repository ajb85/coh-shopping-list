{"fullName":"Brute_Primary_Spines","archetypeOrder":"primary","description":"Spines protrude from your body and can deal damage in melee or at very short ranges. Spines are hollow and hold a neural toxin that deals additional Toxic damage and can Slow or Immobilize your enemies. The toxin is cumulative, and multiple hits will affect a target more strongly.  Very few foes have resistance to Spine poison. Like all scrapper powers, all Spine attacks can sometimes land a critical hit for double damage.","imageName":"SpinesHero.png","displayName":"Spines","powers":[{"allowedEnhancements":["Accuracy","Damage","EnduranceDiscount","Recharge","Slow","Taunt"],"enhancementCount":6,"archetypeOrder":"primary","powerIndex":0,"castTimeReal":0.83,"toggleCost":4.368,"fullName":"Brute_Primary_Spines_Barb_Swipe","displayName":"Barb Swipe","requires":{"powers":{},"count":0},"accuracy":1,"accuracyMult":1,"attackTypes":17,"target":2048,"targetLoS":true,"range":7,"endCost":4.368,"rechargeTime":3,"baseRechargeTime":3,"effectArea":1,"numAllowed":1,"enhancements":[1,4,8,18,22,24],"description":{"short":"Melee, Light DMG(Lethal), DoT(Toxic), -SPD, -Recharge","long":"Shred your opponent with several quick Swipes from your Spines.
