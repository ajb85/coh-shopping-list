You deliver damage to your enemies via withering kicks and punches in melee range, while your skills with thrown blades cut down aggressors from afar.  Your attacks have a tendency to knock opponents down or deal additional damage over time as a secondary effect.","imageName":"MartialCombat.png","displayName":"Martial Assault","powers":[{"castTimeReal":1,"toggleCost":5.2,"displayName":"Shuriken Throw","accuracy":1,"accuracyMult":1,"attackTypes":18,"target":2048,"targetLoS":true,"range":80,"endCost":5.2,"rechargeTime":4,"baseRechargeTime":4,"effectArea":1,"maxBoosts":"6","numAllowed":1,"boostsAllowed":["Accuracy_Boost","Damage_Boost","EnduranceDiscount_Boost","Range_Boost","Recharge_Boost"],"enhancements":[1,4,8,17,18],"description":{"short":"Ranged, Minor DMG(Lethal)","long":"You impale your foe with a thrown shuriken, dealing moderate Lethal damage.
