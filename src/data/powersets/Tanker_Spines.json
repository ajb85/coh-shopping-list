{"description":"Spines protrude from your body and can deal damage in melee or at very short ranges. Spines are hollow and hold a neural toxin that deals additional Toxic damage and can Slow or Immobilize your enemies. The toxin is cumulative, and multiple hits will affect a target more strongly.  Very few foes have resistance to Spine poison. Like all scrapper powers, all Spine attacks can sometimes land a critical hit for double damage.","fullName":"Tanker_Melee.Spines","imageName":"SpinesHero.png","displayName":"Spines","powers":[{"castTimeReal":0.83,"toggleCost":4.368,"fullName":"Tanker_Melee.Spines.Barb_Swipe","displayName":"Barb Swipe","requires":[],"accuracy":1,"accuracyMult":1,"attackTypes":17,"target":2048,"targetLoS":true,"range":7,"endCost":4.368,"rechargeTime":3,"baseRechargeTime":3,"effectArea":2,"radius":4,"maxTargets":5,"maxBoosts":"6","numAllowed":1,"boostsAllowed":["Accuracy_Boost","Damage_Boost","EnduranceDiscount_Boost","Recharge_Boost","Slow_Boost","Taunt_Boost"],"enhancements":[1,4,8,18,22,24],"description":{"short":"Melee, Light DMG(Lethal), DoT(Toxic), -SPD, -Recharge","long":"Shred your opponent with several quick Swipes from your Spines.
