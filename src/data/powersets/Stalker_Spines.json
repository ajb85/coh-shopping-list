{"description":"Spines protrude from your body and can deal damage in melee or at very short ranges. Spines are hollow and hold a neural toxin that deals additional Toxic damage and can Slow or Immobilize your enemies. The toxin is cumulative, and multiple hits will affect a target more strongly.  Very few foes have resistance to Spine poison. Like all Stalker primary attack powers, Spine attacks can land a Critical Hit for double damage, if you are properly Hidden or if your target is Slept or Held.","imageName":"SpinesVillain.png","displayName":"Spines","powers":[{"castTimeReal":0.83,"toggleCost":4.368,"displayName":"Barb Swipe","accuracy":1,"accuracyMult":1,"attackTypes":17,"target":2048,"targetLoS":true,"range":7,"endCost":4.368,"rechargeTime":3,"baseRechargeTime":3,"effectArea":1,"maxBoosts":"6","numAllowed":1,"boostsAllowed":["Accuracy_Boost","Damage_Boost","EnduranceDiscount_Boost","Recharge_Boost","Slow_Boost"],"enhancements":[1,4,8,18,22],"description":{"short":"Melee, Light DMG(Lethal), DoT(Toxic), -SPD, -Recharge","long":"Shred your opponent with several quick Swipes from your Spines.
