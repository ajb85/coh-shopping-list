{"description":"You are able to harness the power of Radiation to crush your foes at range and in close quarters. Radioactive Assault attacks have a chance to inflict the Contaminated state on a target for a moderate amount of time. Powers that deal greater damage, have a longer recharge time and animation time have a greater chance to inflict Contaminated. Hitting Contaminated targets with Neutrino Bolt, Contaminated Strike, Radiation Siphon, X-Ray Beam, Proton Volley and Devastating Blow cause a portion of that power's damage to also hit nearby foes. Radiation Assault attacks primarily deal smashing and energy damage, but this set is also capable of dealing some toxic damage.","fullName":"Dominator_Assault.Radioactive_Assault","imageName":"RadiationBlast.png","displayName":"Radioactive Assault","powers":[{"castTimeReal":1,"toggleCost":5.2,"fullName":"Dominator_Assault.Radioactive_Assault.Neutrino_Bolt","displayName":"Neutrino Bolt","requires":[],"accuracy":1,"accuracyMult":1,"attackTypes":130,"target":2048,"targetLoS":true,"range":80,"endCost":5.2,"rechargeTime":4,"baseRechargeTime":4,"effectArea":2,"radius":8,"maxTargets":5,"maxBoosts":"6","numAllowed":1,"boostsAllowed":["Accuracy_Boost","Damage_Boost","Debuff_Defense_Boost","EnduranceDiscount_Boost","Range_Boost","Recharge_Boost"],"enhancements":[1,4,6,8,17,18],"description":{"short":"Ranged, Minor DMG(Energy), Foe -DEF","long":"A very quick, but low damage attack.
