{"description":"You are able to harness the power of Radiation to crush your foes in close quarters. Radiation Melee attacks have a chance to inflict the Contaminated state on a target for a moderate amount of time. Powers that deal greater damage, have a longer recharge time and animation time have a greater chance to inflict Contaminated. Hitting Contaminated targets with Contaminated Strike, Radioactive Smash, Radiation Siphon and Devastating Blow cause a portion of that power's damage to also hit nearby foes. Radiation Melee attacks primarily deal smashing and energy damage, but this set is also capable of dealing some toxic damage.","fullName":"Scrapper_Melee.Radiation_Melee","imageName":"RadiationBlast.png","displayName":"Radiation Melee","powers":[{"castTimeReal":0.83,"toggleCost":4.368,"fullName":"Scrapper_Melee.Radiation_Melee.Contaminated_Strike","displayName":"Contaminated Strike","requires":[],"accuracy":1,"accuracyMult":1,"attackTypes":137,"target":2048,"targetLoS":true,"range":7,"endCost":4.368,"rechargeTime":3,"baseRechargeTime":3,"effectArea":2,"radius":8,"maxTargets":5,"maxBoosts":"6","numAllowed":1,"boostsAllowed":["Accuracy_Boost","Damage_Boost","Debuff_Defense_Boost","EnduranceDiscount_Boost","Recharge_Boost"],"enhancements":[1,4,6,8,18],"description":{"short":"Melee, Light DMG(Energy/Smash), Foe -Def, Special","long":"You charge your fist with harmful radioactive particles and quickly strike your foe dealing Light Energy and Smashing damage as well as reducing their defense.
